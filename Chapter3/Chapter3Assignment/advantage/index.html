    <h1>CSS Advantages</h1>
    <ul>
          <li class="news">One major advantage of using CSS is that it separates the content of a web page from its visual design, which makes the 
            code easier to organize, read, and update without affecting the actual information.</li>
        <li>Another advantage of CSS is that it creates consistency across multiple web pages by allowing the
            same fonts, colors, and layouts to be applied through a single external style sheet.</li>
        <li>A final advantage of CSS is that it improves website maintenance by allowing design changes to be made 
            in one location and automatically applied to every connected page.</li>
    </ul>
